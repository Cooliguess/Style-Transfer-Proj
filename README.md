# Style-Transfer-Proj

Prerequisites:
  Python 3.7 or higher
  TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
  Maybe more idk these are the ones that I found I needed

Installation steps:
  1. To clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Cooliguess/Style-Transfer-Proj.git
  2. Install the required dependencies:
    alot of them should be in the code but if not, keras, tensorflow, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib...

Also:
  Prepare your training dataset of real images and preprocess them accordingly. Use this guy https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/horse2zebra-dataset/code and rename it to horse2zebra.npz
  Update the code to load and preprocess your training data.
  Adjust the hyperparameters in the code (e.g., number of epochs, batch size) to your desired values.

If someone can fix my code and tell me why as well, that'd also be great!

Thanks
